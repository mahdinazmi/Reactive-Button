# Reactive Button Package

This package provides a customizable button widget with built-in loading, success, and failure states. It's designed to work with Flutter's `Bloc` architecture and allows you to pass your own functions for handling success and failure.

## Features
- Display a loading indicator when the button is pressed.
- Automatically handle success and failure states.
- Pass custom actions to be executed on button press.
- Easily customize what happens when the action succeeds or fails via callbacks.

## Installation

Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```dart
dependencies:
  reactive_button: ^0.0.1
  ```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the package.
